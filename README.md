# Labs
The labs listed here are sorted by date in ascending order.
## IAM_policy_EC2_Full_Access_with_conditions
Create an IAM policy that allows full access to Amazon EC2, subject to the following conditions:
- The `ec2:InstanceType` must be `t3.micro` AND
- The `aws:RequestedRegion` must be in one of the following regions: `["us-west-1", "us-west-2", "us-east-1", "us-east-2"]`
## Create_launch_template_and_Spot_Fleet_request
Create a launch template and an EC2 Spot Fleet request using Terraform in AWS.
## NAT_gateway_architecture
Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), public subnet, private subnet, NAT Gateway in the public subnet, Elastic IP for the NAT Gateway, and an Internet Gateway (which is attached to the VPC). Create a custom route table and associate it to the public subnet; another route table will be created and associated to the private subnet. A custom default security group and default network access control list (network ACL) is defined in the Terraform code. A network ACL is created and applied to the public and private subnets for example purposes.
## S3_Cross_Region_Replication
Configure Amazon S3 Cross Region Replication from a source bucket in a region to a destination bucket in another region.
## Gateway_VPC_Endpoint_for_S3
Create a gateway Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) endpoint for Amazon S3. VPC endpoints are highly available and allow connections between a VPC and supported services, such as Amazon S3, so VPC connectivity to the Internet is not required.
## VPC_endpoints_for_SSM
Connect remotely to the EC2 instance using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager *without* having to use an internet gateway, a public IPv4 address assigned to one of the elastic network interfaces of the EC2 instance, and a security group rule that allows port 22 inbound traffic. Create and configure VPC endpoints for AWS Systems Manager.
## Dual_stack_VPC_Internet_connectivity
Create a highly available architecture to allow EC2 instances in public subnets to connect to the Internet Gateway for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. EC2 instances in private subnets are connected to a NAT Gateway for IPv4 traffic originating from the instance or the Egress-Only Internet Gateway for IPv6 traffic originating from the instance.
